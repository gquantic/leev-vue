                    At an additional cost, you could check in at any time of the day. If your stay is booked for more than one day, leev offers a second cleaning of its apartments. Cleaning takes place between 11 a.m. and 2
                    p.m., so you only have to choose the day when you would like to have the apartment cleaned again. You can also order a car transfer, laundry or dry-cleaning services by simply informing our concierge.

                    Each of our apartments is equipped with smart locks, so you do not have to worry about access to the apartment. Simply book a property and we will send you a notification to your mobile phone with the
                    address and the access code to your mobile phone.
